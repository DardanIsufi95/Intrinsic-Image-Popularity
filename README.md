# Intrinsic image popularity Predictor

This is a PyTorch implementation of *Intrinsic Image Popularity Prediction: Focusing on the Visual Content*.

This work can objectively and quantitatively predict how much traction an image will get on Instagram by computing the image popularity score. It can help users to choose the image that would be the most popular to the public.

run ```python test.py [image_path]``` to evaluate your intrinsic image popularity on Instagram.

**Wait to add**:
1. The raw data of Instagram post information. (The first publicly available large-scale dataset on Instagram. It opens the doors for several interesting directions on Instagram, not only for image popularity prediction, but image captioning, image tagging, emoji prediction and so on.)
2. The generated DPIP dataset.
